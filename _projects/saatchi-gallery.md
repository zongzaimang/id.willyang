intro: |-
  The Saatchi gallery is revered for its ability to introduce almost unknown
  artists into the public eye; the careers of Damien Hirst and Tracy Emin were
  launched from the exposure Saatchi gave them and the gallery boasts the
  largest private collection of artwork in the world.

  Over the years the gallery has retained itâ€™s success but has never gained a
  larger public audience, partly down to not having a consistent brand attached
  to it; a disjointed mix of different logos and related imagery from the
  various outlets (in-gallery, online and magazine) has diluted the potential of
  the Saatchi name.
