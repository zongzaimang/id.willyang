intro: |
  The COLBOR CL60R is a potent RGB LED light at 65W. A total of 10 such COBs can construct a light matrix up to 650W, thanks to the PowerCube Design and Matrix Control that are shared by the CL60 series. The 2700-6500K color temperature and 360Â° full color adjustment go with the sound recognition function to customize the lighting environment for indoor and outdoor uses.
