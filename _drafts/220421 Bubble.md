intro: |
  Butterfly is a social networking app which aims at connecting skilled
  creatives across any discipline.

  One of the most important goals of Butterfly is to provide reassurance to
  artists that they still have the rights any work they upload, and that their
  privacy is respected.

  I created the architecture, data requirements and UX flow of the application,
  first making a low fidelity prototype to test with users.
