intro: |
  The absence of full mobile device support was negatively impacting on
  Ski Solution's conversions and search engine rankings considerably. The site
  at the time had a separate mobile site with a stripped down feature-set. The
  solution was to create a fully redesigned responsive experience and optimise
  the website from the bottom up to improve SEO and drive enquiries.

  Working from a mobile first approach, I redesigned the site to work across
  mobile, tablet and desktop, creating a CSS framework and icon font to maintain
  consistency with the colours, geometry and component styles.
